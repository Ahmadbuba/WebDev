## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- @media-Queries

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I was able to better understand the way the flex-box is applied, alignments and directions, I also found interesting the way in which I could use the image in a volatile way.

### Continued development

"Media Queries" is really a challenge, but I'm learning ways to make the layout more responsive and more pleasant, I know this layout wasn't excellent, but I'll keep studying to improve it.
